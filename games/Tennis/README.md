# Tennis

This is my implementation of the classic tennis game.
It is a bit messy and most of the code is the Ball class. Because the ball needs
a lot of references, the constructor nedded a lot of parameters.


### building

`haxe tennis.hxml`

This producess a `tennis.js` file in the out directory. In the out directory is also a `index.html` file
