# Space Invasion

This is my implementation of a space invasion game. This time i used more of a procedural style of programming and made the whole game in one file. I also used some sprites in combination with an h2d.Anim to give the aliens some animation.


### play

Play it [here](https://philip-erd.github.io/CodeTheClassics/games/spaceInvasion/index.html).

#### controlls

- left: left arrow or A
- right: right arrow or D
- shoot: spacebar


### building

`haxe spaceInvasion.hxml`

This producess a `spaceInvasion.js` file in the out directory. In the out directory is also a `index.html` file

### run
Host the out directory on a http-server and open it in a browser.
