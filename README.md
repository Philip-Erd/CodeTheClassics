# CodeTheClassics
A repository where I try to recode some classic video games (or games inspired by them) using various game engines and frameworks.

All the games are in the games subfolder.

You can try out the games [here](https://philip-erd.github.io/CodeTheClassics/).

If not mentioned otherwise, all the code, resources and other things are under the MIT-license.
