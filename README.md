# CodeTheClassics
A repository where I try to recode some classic video games (or games inspired by them) using haxe and heaps.

I am very new to haxe and heaps, so this is my learning experience. All the games
ar in the games subfolder. A game controller is the primary input device, but some games, like shooting games, may use the mouse.

If not mentioned otherwise, all the code, resources and other things are under the MIT-license.
